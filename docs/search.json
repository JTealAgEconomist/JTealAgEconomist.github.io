    "text": "I am an agricultural economist with research interests in applied risk analysis, finance, and firm resilience. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wisconsin – Madison and expect to graduate in May 2026. I received a M.Sc. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of California – Davis and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Tennessee – Knoxville. I have previously worked at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors focusing on capital markets and financial forecasting, the Conservation Strategy Fund, and the United States Department of Agriculture as an Economic Research Service Pathways Intern. I am on the 2025-2026 job market.\nMy work focuses on using high-resolution spatial data paired with large administrative data to assess the risks faced by agricultural firms. My goal is to leverage technological advances in data collection and statistical inference to provide policy relevant research on risk mitigation and resiliency. My dissertation examines the nuances of agricultural diversification; namely, how best to measure agricultural intensification and diversification as opposed to landscape diversification, agricultural diversification’s effect on banking resilience, and the role livestock and crop processors have in changing agricultural diversification. Specifically, my job market paper analyzes how different types of agricultural diversification exposure experienced by agricultural lenders affect real estate and agricultural production loan delinquency rates."

By taking advantage of these economies of scale, producers choose to specialize in only a small number of crops. Although specialization has the benefits of higher expected returns, there is a trade-off with increased risk exposure. Consequently, increases in large scale specialization have increased risk for agricultural lenders. This is especially true for regional banks which may only lend to producers in a small number of neighboring counties. I evaluate whether declines in crop diversification have negatively impacted agricultural loan performance and if certain types of diversification have less of an impact than other types. I show that diversification does have an impact on delinquency rates of agricultural loans. Contrary to conventional wisdom, diversification increases delinquency rates for agricultural production loans and real estate loans secured by farmland. A one standard deviation increase in a lender’s diversification exposure raises production loan delinquencies by over 13% and real estate loan delinquencies by 11%. The negative impact of diversification on real estate loans is primarily driven by diversification “within similar” crop groups. My results suggest that not all diversification is created equally, and some forms of diversification are actually risk increasing instead of risk mitigating.\n\n\n\nWorks In Progress\n\n\nTeal, J., “Measurement Differences in Agricultural Diversification”\nHow do measures of agricultural diversification differ across different data sources of land cover? This research highlights how different data sources are not interchangeable and which data sources are best for certain types of projects. Primary diversification indexes are calculated using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) and the Farm Service Agency (FSA) Crop Acreage Data, from 2009 to 2018. When selecting on highly productive counties and crops, CDL and FSA diversification are highly similar with a correlation coefficient of 0.82. When comparing county-year pairs across the entire data set, differences become more extreme with a lower correlation coefficient of 0.52. Differences also exhibit a non-random behavior violating classical measurement error. As CDL diversification increases, CDL diversification becomes increasingly more diversified than FSA.\nTeal, J., “Downstream Intensification and Local Landscape Diversification: How Increased Demand for Agricultural Inputs Changes Local Landscapes”\nHow agricultural products are used has an impact on the intensity a crop is grown. The U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard greatly increased corn acreage. Similarly in the coming years, as the demand for biodiesel increases, soybean acreage will need to increase to match that demand. With growing urban pressure on farmlands and the current level of agricultural intensification in the United States, additional soybean acreage is likely to be substituted from other crops to soybeans instead of new farm acres being planted. How does the increased demand for an agricultural input change local landscape diversification? I answer this question using the introduction of soybean crush plants; ethanol refineries; meat, poultry and egg slaughter facilities; and local landcover from the Cropland Data Layer. When soybean crush plants; ethanol refineries; and meat, poultry and egg slaughter facilities enter an area, there is an increased demand for local agricultural inputs to supply these facilities. I take advantage of this variation to determine if local landscape diversification changes, or if these plants choose to open in locations with excess supply of the needed inputs."
