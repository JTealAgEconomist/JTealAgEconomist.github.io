I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the Agricultural and Applied Economics Department. I hold a master’s degree in agricultural and resource economics from the University of California–Davis and a bachelor’s degree in economics from the University of Tennessee. Previously I have worked at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and interned at the Economic Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. In 2023, I was selected as a Farm Foundation Agricultural Scholar. My research focuses on diversification, agricultural finance, and risk management, which has led to multiple publications in top agricultural research journals.
