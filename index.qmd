I am an agricultural economist with research interests in applied risk analysis, finance, and firm resilience. Currently, I am a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Wisconsin – Madison and expect to graduate in May 2026. I received a M.Sc. in Agricultural and Resource Economics from the University of California – Davis and a B.A. in Economics from the University of Tennessee – Knoxville. I have previously worked at the Federal Reserve Board of Governors focusing on capital markets and financial forecasting, the Conservation Strategy Fund, and the United States Department of Agriculture as an Economic Research Service Pathways Intern. I am on the 2025-2026 job market.

My work focuses on using high-resolution spatial data paired with large administrative data to assess the risks faced by agricultural firms. My goal is to leverage technological advances in data collection and statistical inference to provide policy relevant research on risk mitigation and resiliency. My dissertation examines the nuances of agricultural diversification; namely, how best to measure agricultural intensification and diversification as opposed to landscape diversification, agricultural diversification’s effect on banking resilience, and the role livestock and crop processors have in changing agricultural diversification. Specifically, my job market paper analyzes how different types of agricultural diversification exposure experienced by agricultural lenders affect real estate and agricultural production loan delinquency rates.
